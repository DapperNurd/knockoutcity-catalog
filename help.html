				<h2>Instructions</h2>
				<h1>Outfits</h1>
				<img class="main-img" src="Help\Outfit.png" alt="AyChristene" width="100">
				<p class="info">Outfits are annoying in that I need 8 individual images. I specifically want your player model to be in this pose (You can cycle the pose by either changing player loadout or by going in and out of "Player Customization". Then, I just need a screenshot of each selected style of the outfit. Make sure you're in the style menu so the background is darkened. I need 8 images, 4 for each body type. Body Type A is the feminine body, and B is the masculine body. Outfits are the only cosmetic item in which I use the cosmetic on the actual player model rather than the icon for it.</p>
				<h1>Gloves</h1>
				<img class="main-img" src="Help\glove1.png" alt="AyChristene" width="100">
				<img class="main-img" src="Help\glove2.png" alt="AyChristene" width="100">
				<p class="info">I only need 2 images for gloves. The goal is to just get the image with the purple border, with the least amount of blockage. This means that I need the images unequiped and unselected. Since there is always going to be one selected, I get around this by using two photos. Let's say that you open the style menu and it is selected on the first style. Taking a screenshot there will give me the last 3 styles unselected. Then, select a different one and take another screenshot so I can now get the first. That is what is going on in the images. Since you won't be sending all styles like you would with outfits, I will need you to tell me the names of at least the two that are not selected in one of the screenshots. If this isn't clear, feel free to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/DapperNurd">message me on Reddit</a>.</p>
				<h1>Player Icon</h1>
				<img class="main-img" src="Help\icon.png" alt="AyChristene" width="100">
				<p class="info">For player icons, I don't use the display icon but rather the actual icon that is equipped. This means that when you want to send a player icon, just simply have it equipped in the screenshot. The green arrow is showing what I use to take the picture. Crew banners are done the same way, but I didn't think I needed to make another section for that.</p>
				<h1>Crew Logo</h1>
				<img class="main-img" src="Help\logo.png" alt="AyChristene" width="100">
				<p class="info">I'm also pretty picky when it comes to the crew logos. The way I get the pictures is pretty specific. Like I said before, I want it to be unselected and unequipped with no obstructions. The only way to do that with crew logos is to have them 2 slots away from the center of your selector. I have green arrows pointing to where this spot is. For taking a crew logo picture, put both of the logo parts together in this side and just take a screenshot. I will also need to know the name.</p>
				<h1>Everything Else</h1>
				<img class="main-img" src="Help\everything else.png" alt="AyChristene" width="100">
				<p class="info">Every other cosmetic is pretty straight forward. Just have the item unselected and unequipped. A good example for this image would be the Ponytail hair style. A bad example would be the Straight and Messy hair style.</p>
				<br>
				<p class="info">Sorry for all of the walls of text, I just want the images on this site to be as consistent as possible. Thanks for helping :)</p>
